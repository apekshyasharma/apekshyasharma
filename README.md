## 👩‍💻 About Me

I am a motivated Artificial Intelligence undergraduate currently pursuing **BSc (Hons) Computing with Artificial Intelligence**.

I have hands-on experience building **machine learning, deep learning, NLP, and generative AI systems**, along with experience as an **AI educator**, where I translate complex AI concepts into practical, real-world applications.

I enjoy working on applied AI projects, writing clean and well-structured documentation, and continuously improving my technical depth through project-based learning and experimentation.

I am particularly interested in **human-centered AI**, intelligent systems, and using data-driven approaches to solve meaningful problems.
